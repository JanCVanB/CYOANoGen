This is my submission for [National Novel Generation Month 2017](https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/2017).

I've posted my plan here https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/2017/issues/24, and I'll update the thread with any changes.


## TODO

- ~Create an interface for interacting with an adventure~
- Create a (minimal) hard-coded adventure
- Create an interface for submitting adventure inputs
- Create an engine for generating adventures from inputs
